#
# For now, we depend on the itm branch of Oxide's fork of probe-rs (!).  We
# need the itm branch for the read_swv() function in the session (and more
# generally, for its implementation of SWV) -- and we need the Oxide fork for
# several bug fixes needed for the LPC55 in particular.  As soon as we can get
# these changes elsewhere, this dependency should be changed!
