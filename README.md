# Humility

Humility is the debugger for
<a href="https://github.com/oxidecomputer/hubris">Hubris</a>.

## Guiding principles

### Production disposition

Hubris is the artifact that actually runs, and it must be allowed to be
optimized in terms of size, space, and run-time; in as much as contortions are
required for debuggability, they should be borne by Humility, not Hubris.  As a
concrete example of this, Humility operates exclusively on `release` builds of
Hubris, relying on (unloaded) DWARF information in the binaries to make sense of
the system.

### Hubris-specific

Humility is Hubris-specific:  it is not trying to be a generic *in situ*
debugger, but rather specifically focused on debugging Hubris-based systems.
Humility is therefore willing to encode Hubris-specific concepts like
archives and tasks.

### Microcontroller-specific

Debuggers must cut through abstractions, which
often requires knowledge of underlying
implementation detail.  For Humility, this means being willing to take
advantage of microcontroller-specific debug facilities where applicable.
While Hubris may make decisions in the name of greater portability,
Humility will generally make decisions to maximize debuggability, even
where these facilities are highly specific to a particular MCU.

### Device-specific

Humility is unafraid to offer device-specific functionality where that
functionality is useful for system debuggability.  (For example,
`humility i2c` functions as an I<sup>2</sup>C analyzer.)  That said, all device
interaction uses Hubris as a proxy to actually communicate with the devices
themselves (e.g., via [HIF](https://github.com/oxidecomputer/hif));
Humility does not seek to create second I/O path.

### Pragmatic

Humility seeks to be *useful*, and therefore seeks to offer all manners of
debugging: in situ, postmortem, dynamic instrumentation, static
instrumentation, etc.

## Operation

Humility operates by specifying a subcommand.  There are options that
are Humility-wide (that is, applying to every subcommand), as well as
options that are specific to particular subcommands.

### Probe

Humility needs to have some way of extracting information and/or controlling
the microcontroller running Hubris.  This is done through some variant of a
debug *probe*, a separate microcontroller that speaks to debug-specific
functionality on the target microcontroller.  (For details of the mechanics
of these probes on ARM parts, see <a
href="https://65.rfd.oxide.computer">RFD 65</a>.)

For most evaluation boards, this debug probe is available on the board, and
is connected to a host via USB, e.g. ST's STLink/V2 on the STM32F407
Discovery or the LPC-Link2 present on the LPCXpresso55S69.
(On the Gemini board, there are two SWD headers, one for the LPC55S28
and the other for the STM32H753.)
While Humility allows for direct attachment to an on-chip debugger, doing so
precludes other connections (from, for example, OpenOCD), making it too
disruptive to development workflows. To allow for easier development
workflows, Humility also has the option to attach via OpenOCD.

The debug probe to use is specified to Humility via the `-p` option
(long form `--probe`) or the `HUMILITY_PROBE` environment variable,
which can have the following values:

- `auto` (default): Automatically determine how to attach to the
  microcontroller.

- `ocd`: Attach via OpenOCD, which is presumed to have the TCL interface
  available on localhost on port 6666 (its default).

- `jlink`: Attach via Segger JLink, which is presumed to have the GDB
  interface available on localhost on port 2331 (its default).  Note that
  when semihosting is being used by Hubris, the Segger JLink GDB server
  will become confused when Humility attaches to it -- and subsequent
  calls to semihosting will cause a halt.  A subsequent Humility invocation
  will resume the target (directing semihosting output correctly to the
  running GDB instance), but subsequent semihosting output will again cause
  a halt. To recover from this condition, send an explicit ^C to the
  running GDB and continue from the resulting stop.

- `usb`: Attach directly via USB to a debug probe.  When multiple probes
  are plugged in via USB, a probe index must be specified as a suffix
  (e.g., `usb-0`, `usb-1`, etc.)  To determine which probe is which,
  examine the serial number in the output of `humility probe`.

- `vid:pid[:serial]`: In some cases, the automatic algorithm may either find
  the wrong thing, or timeout attempting to search for non-existent probes.
  In these cases, it can help to explicitly set the vendor ID (VID) and
  product ID (PID) of the debug probe, which should be colon-delimited, e.g.,
  `0483:374e`.  (Determining the VID and PID of an attached probe is
  platform-specific; on Linux one can use the `lsusb` command.)  In cases
  where there are multiple probes with the same VID and PID, the serial number
  of the probe (as reported via `humility probe` or found in the 
  `iSerialNumber` field of the USB device descriptor) can be postpended,
  also delimited by a colon, e.g. `0483:374e:004000343137510939383538`.

### Archive

Many Humility commands require the complete Hubris archive.  This is a ZIP
archive created by the build process, and includes all binaries as well as the
`app.toml` file used to configure the Hubris archive.  The archive can be
found in the `target` for Hubris, and will end with (`.zip`), e.g.:
`/path/to/hubris/target/demo-stm32h743-nucleo/dist/build-demo-stm32h743-nucleo.zip`.
The Hubris archive is specified via the `-a` option or the `HUMILITY_ARCHIVE`
environment variable.

**In the Humility examples in this documentation, unless otherwise specified,
the archive will be assumed to be set via `-a` or `HUMILITY_ARCHIVE`.**

### Dump

Many Humility commands are able to operate *postmortem* on a Hubris dump,
an ELF core file generated by the `humility dump` command.
Dumps are offered in lieu of a probe and an archive and specified via
the `-d` option (long form `--dump`) or the `HUMILITY_DUMP` environment
variable.

### Chip

While some autodetection is possible, Humility regrettably may need to be made
aware of the specifics of the target chip.  Supported chips include:

- `STM32F407VGTx` (default): STM32F407 as found on the reference Discovery board
- `LPC55S69JBD100`: LPC55S69 as found on the LPCXpresso55S69
- `STM32H7B3LIHxQ`: STM32H7B3 as found on the STM32H7B3I-DK

The target chip can be specified via the `-c` option or the `HUMILITY_CHIP`
environment variable.

### `humility apptable`

This is a deprecated command that allows for the display of the app table
found in old Hubris arhives; see `humility manifest` to understand
the contents of an archive.



### `humility dashboard`

Provides a captive dashboard that graphs sensor values over time.  (The
`sensor` task is required for operation; see the documentation for
`humility sensors` for more details.)

If `-o` is provided, it specifies an output file for any raw sensor data
graphed by the dashboard.



### `humility diagnose`

This subcommand provides a "firmware engineer in a can" for scanning and
reporting issues in a running system. It's mostly concerned with

- Noticing things that seem fishy, and
- Taking action to get good snapshots of those things.

This is application-independent logic, so it doesn't have any visibility
into things the _application_ may think are fishy -- only general behaviors
at the OS level, like faults.


### `humility dump`

`humility dump` takes a dump of the attached system, writing out an ELF
core file:

```console
% humility dump
humility: attached via ST-Link
humility: core halted
humility: dumping to hubris.core.0
humility: dumped 1.12MB in 24 seconds
humility: core resumed
```

A dump file name may also be specified:

```console
% humility dump hubris.core.`date +%s`
humility: attached via ST-Link
humility: core halted
humility: dumping to hubris.core.1600718079
humility: dumped 1.12MB in 24 seconds
humility: core resumed
```

The resulting dump can be used with many commands (including `manifest`,
`map`, `readvar`, and `tasks`) -- and need not be run on the same machine
as the debugged MCU, e.g.:

```console
% humility -d hubris.core.0 tasks
humility: attached to dump
ID ADDR     TASK               GEN STATE
 0 20000168 jefe                 0 Healthy(InRecv(None))

 3 200002b8 usart_driver         0 Healthy(InRecv(None))
 4 20000328 i2c_driver           0 Healthy(InRecv(None))

 7 20000478 ping                40 Healthy(InReply(TaskId(0x3)))
 8 200004e8 adt7420              0 Healthy(InRecv(Some(TaskId(0xffff))))
 9 20000558 idle                 0 Healthy(Runnable)          <-
```



### `humility etm`

No documentation yet for `humility etm`; pull requests welcome!

### `humility flash`

Flashes the target with the image that is contained within the specified
archive (or dump).  This merely executes the underlying flashing
mechanism (either PyOCD or OpenOCD, depending on the target); if the
requisite software is not installed (or isn't in the path), this will
fail.  Temporary files are created as part of this process; if they are to
be retained, the `-R` (`--retain-temporaries`) flag should be set.
To see what would be executed without actually executing any commands,
use the `-n` (`--dry-run`) flag.  As a precautionary measure, if
the specified archive already appears to be on the target, `humility
flash` will fail unless the `-F` (`--force`) flag is set.



### `humility gpio`

No documentation yet for `humility gpio`; pull requests welcome!

### `humility hiffy`

`humility hiffy` allows for querying and manipulation of `hiffy`, the
HIF agent present in Hubris.  To list all Idol interfaces present in
Hubris, use the `-l` (`--list`) option:

```console
% humility hiffy -l
humility: attached via ST-Link
TASK            INTERFACE    OPERATION           ARG             ARGTYPE
rcc_driver      Rcc          enable_clock_raw    peripheral      u32
                             disable_clock_raw   peripheral      u32
                             enter_reset_raw     peripheral      u32
                             leave_reset_raw     peripheral      u32
spi_driver      Spi          read                device_index    u8
                             write               device_index    u8
                             exchange            device_index    u8
                             lock                device_index    u8
                                                 cs_state        CsState
                             release             -
user_leds       UserLeds     led_on              index           usize
                             led_off             index           usize
                             led_toggle          index           usize
```

To enlist the Hubris agent to call a particular interface and operation,
use `-c` (`--call`), using `-a` (`--arguments`) to indicate any arguments,
e.g.:

```console
% humility hiffy -c UserLeds.led_toggle -a index=0
humility: attached via ST-Link
UserLeds.led_toggle() = ()
```

To view the raw HIF functions provided to programmatic HIF consumers
within Humility, use `-L` (`--list-functions`).



### `humility i2c`

On platforms that have I<sup>2</sup>C support, `humility i2c` can be used
to scan a bus, scan a device, read a register, or write a register.  Its
usage will be specific to the board being examined; to specify a
controller use the `-c`, to specify a port (if necessary), use `-p`; to
specify a mux and segment (if necessary), use `-m`.

For example, on a Gimletlet, here is a scan of controller I2C3, revealing
one device at address `0x48`:

```console
% humility i2c -s -c 3
humility: attached via ST-Link

Device scan on controller I2C3:

    R = Reserved   - = No device   \o/ = Device found   X = Timed out

ADDR     0x0 0x1 0x2 0x3 0x4 0x5 0x6 0x7 0x8 0x9 0xa 0xb 0xc 0xd 0xe 0xf
0x00       R   R   R   R   R   R   R   R   -   -   -   -   -   -   -   -
0x10       -   -   -   -   -   -   -   -   -   -   -   -   -   -   -   -
0x20       -   -   -   -   -   -   -   -   -   -   -   -   -   -   -   -
0x30       -   -   -   -   -   -   -   -   -   -   -   -   -   -   -   -
0x40       -   -   -   -   -   -   -   - \o/   -   -   -   -   -   -   -
0x50       -   -   -   -   -   -   -   -   -   -   -   -   -   -   -   -
0x60       -   -   -   -   -   -   -   -   -   -   -   -   -   -   -   -
0x70       -   -   -   -   -   -   -   -   -   -   -   -   R   R   R   R
```

To scan that device, specify its address via `-d`:

```console
% humility i2c -s -c 3 -d 0x48
humility: attached via ST-Link

Register scan for device 0x48 on I2C3:

      - = No register        ! = No device        X = Timed out

ADDR  0x0 0x1 0x2 0x3 0x4 0x5 0x6 0x7 0x8 0x9 0xa 0xb 0xc 0xd 0xe 0xf

```

(This device is an ADT7420 temp sensor.)  To look at a particular
register, elide `-s` and specify the register of interest via `-r`:

```console
% humility i2c -c 3 -d 0x48 -r 0xb
humility: attached via ST-Link
Controller I2C3, device 0x48, register 0xb = 0xcb
```

To write a value to a register, specify the `-w` flag, along with the
value to write, e.g. (for the ADT7420), the MSB of the T<sub>HIGH</sub>
register:

```console
% humility i2c -c 3 -d 0x48 -r 0x4 -w 0x1f
humility: attached via ST-Link
Controller I2C3, device 0x48, register 0x4 = 0x1f
```

Note that if registers are not writable, the write will (generally) be
silently discarded by the device; it can be useful to read the register
after writing it to confirm that the value is as expected:

```console
% humility i2c -c 3 -d 0x48 -r 0x4
humility: attached via ST-Link
Controller I2C3, device 0x48, register 0x4 = 0x1f
```



### `humility itm`

`humility itm` consumes data from the Instrumentation Trace Macrocell
(ITM) present in many ARM Cortex-M variants.  ITM is problematic in many
dimensions: it is lossy; it requires knowledge of the target's clocking to
configure properly; it relies on functionality (SWO/SWV) that is often
buggy in chip debuggers; it isn't present everywhere (Cortex-M0+ in
particular doesn't have ITM).  So in general, ITM isn't what Hubris
programmers should be looking for:  those developing code and wishing to
see if and how that code is executed should prefer ring buffers to
ITM-based instrumentation.  (See the documentation for `humility ringbuf`
for details.)

That said, ITM remains the best way to get certain messages from the
Hubris kernel (e.g., boot and panic messages); use `humility itm -ea` to
enable ITM and attach to the connected device.  For example, if running
with the `ping` task, one will see messages from `jefe` restarting it:

```console
% humility -a /path/to/my/hubris-archive.zip itm -ea
humility: attached via ST-Link
humility: core halted
humility: core resumed
humility: ITM synchronization packet found at offset 6
Task #7 Divide-by-zero
Task #7 Memory fault at address 0x0
Task #7 Divide-by-zero
```



### `humility jefe`

Humility allows for some (well-defined) manipulation of tasks via `jefe`,
the Hubris supervisor.  By default, `jefe` will restart any faulting task;
when debugging, it can be useful to hold a task in the faulted state. This
is done via the `-h` option:

```console
% humility jefe -h ping
humility: attached via ST-Link
humility: successfully changed disposition for ping
```

This does not change the task, but rather `jefe`'s restart disposition; when
the task next faults, it will not be restarted, e.g.:

```console
% humility tasks ping
humility: attached via ST-Link
system time = 26597
ID TASK                 GEN PRI STATE
 8 ping                 121   4 FAULT: divide by zero (was: ready)
```

This can be particularly useful to couple with either `humility dump` or
`humility tasks -sl`:

```console
% humility tasks -sl ping
humility: attached via ST-Link
system time = 103879
ID TASK                 GEN PRI STATE
 8 ping                 121   4 FAULT: divide by zero (was: ready)
   |
   +--->  0x200065b0 0x0802a05e task_ping::divzero
                     @ /home/bmc/hubris/task/ping/src/main.rs:24
          0x20006600 0x0802a0fe userlib::sys_panic
                     @ /home/bmc/hubris/sys/userlib/src/lib.rs:678
          0x20006600 0x0802a0fe main
                     @ /home/bmc/hubris/task/ping/src/main.rs:35

```

To change the disposition of a task (back) to be restarted, use the `-r` flag:

```console
% humility jefe -r ping
humility: attached via ST-Link
humility: successfully changed disposition for ping
```

To inject a fault into a task, use the `-f` flag, which will change the
disposition to injecting a fault.  The injected fault has a dedicated type to
make clear that the fault originated outside of the task:

```console
% humility jefe -f pong
humility: attached via ST-Link
humility: successfully changed disposition for pong
% humility tasks pong

```

To restart a task that has had a fault injected, again use the `-r` flag to
change its disposition back to restart.

Finally, to start a task that is not started by default, use the `-s` flag.

### `humility manifest`

`humility manifest` displays information about the Hubris archive.  It
does not connect at all to a Hubris target to operate.  In addition to
archive-wide attributes, `humility manifest` displays the features enabled
for each task, as well as any device toplogy information present in
the archive, e.g.:

```console
% humility manifest

```

`humility manifest` can operate on either an archive or on a dump.


### `humility map`

One common pathology in Hubris tasks is a fault induced when a task
attempts to access a memory address outside of its designated regions.
(This can happen, for example, because the task attempted to access device
memory that was not allocated to it in the build description, because it
exceeded the device memory allocated to it, or because it allocated the
memory allocated to it, e.g., because of a stack overflow.) `humility
tasks` can be useful to see this happening; a non-zero generation count
will indicate that a task has been restarted -- and the log message from
`jefe` will indicate the specific address, e.g.:

```console
% humility itm -ea
humility: attached via OpenOCD
humility: core halted
humility: core resumed
humility: TPIU sync packet found at offset 1
humility: ITM synchronization packet found at offset 12
Task #7 Memory fault at address 0x200028fc
Task #7 Memory fault at address 0x200028fc
^C
```

To better understand the memory that a task is trying to access, one can
run the `humility map` command, which shows the memory regions that have
been mapped into tasks, in address order:

```console
% humility -a ~/hubris/target/demo/dist/build-demo.zip map
humility: attached via OpenOCD
DESC       LOW          HIGH          SIZE ATTR  ID TASK

0x08004834 0x40023800 - 0x40023bff    1KiB rw-d-  1 rcc_driver
```

(In this case, task 7, `oh_no`, has overflowed its stack -- which
we can see from the `map` output has been sized to only 256 bytes.)

### `humility probe`

`humility probe` attempts to infer as much about the hardware state as it
can, e.g.:

```console

`humility readmem` allows one to read a specified range of memory:

```console

```

If an argument is present, it is the number of bytes to read:

```console
$ humility readmem 0x00011d00 100
humility: attached via DAPLink
humility: reading at 0x11d00 for 100 bytes
             \/  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  a  b  c  d  e  f

```

Both arguments can be in either hex, decimal, octal or binary (addresses
and contents will always be printed in hex):

```console
humility readmem 0o216401 0b110
humility: attached via DAPLink
humility: reading at 0x11d01 for 6 bytes
              0 \/  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  a  b  c  d  e  f

```

To display as half-words (16-bits) use `-h`; to display as words (32-bits)
use `-w`.  (The addresses must be 2-byte and 4-byte aligned, respectively.)

```console
$ humility readmem -w 0x20000000 0x40
humility: attached via DAPLink
humility: reading at 0x20000000 for 64 bytes
                   \/        4        8        c

0x20000030 | 00004d28 00004d28 00004d28 00004d28 | (M..(M..(M..(M..
```

A frequent use of `readmem` is to read peripheral memory; as a
convenience, a peripheral name can be used in lieu of an address, provided
that an archive or dump is also specified:

```console
$ humility -a ~/hubris/target/gemini-bu/dist/build-gemini-bu.zip readmem -w i2c4
0x30
humility: attached via ST-Link
                   \/        4        8        c
0x58001c00 | 000000f7 00020490 00008000 00008000 | ................
0x58001c10 | 10c0ecff 00000000 00000021 00000000 | ........!.......
0x58001c20 | 00000000 00000080 00000000 00000000 | ................
```

**Note that reading some peripheral memory may have side effects!**

It can also be useful to interpret memory contents symbolically; to do this,
provide a dump or achive and specify the `-s` option, e.g.:

```console
$ humility  -a ~/hubris/target/gemini-bu-rot/dist/build-gemini-bu-rot.zip readmem -s 0x20004b30 0x40
humility: attached via DAPLink
0x20004b30 | 0x20004bdc

```



### `humility readvar`

`humility readvar` allows one to read a global static variable.
To list all such variables, use the `-l` option:

```console
% humility readvar -l
humility: MODULE             VARIABLE                       ADDR       SIZE

### `humility ringbuf`

`humility ringbuf` reads and displays any Hubris ring buffers (as created
via the `ringbuf!` macro in the Hubris `ringbuf` crate).  e.g.:

```console
% humility -d ./hubris.core.5 ringbuf
ADDR        NDX LINE  GEN    COUNT PAYLOAD

### `humility sensors`

`humility sensors` communicates with the `sensor` Hubris task via its
`Sensor` Idol interface to get sensor data.  If there is no `sensor` task
or if there are no sensors defined in the in Hurbis application
description, this command will not provide any meaningful output. To list
all available sensors, use `-l` (`--list`); to summarize sensor values,
use `-s` (`--summarize`).  To constrain sensors by type, use the `-t`
(`--types`) option; to constrain sensors by device, use the `-d`
(`--devices`) option; to constrain sensors by name, use the `-n`
(`--named`) option.  Within each option, multiple specifications serve as
a logical OR (that is, (`-d raa229618,tmp117` would yield all sensors from
either device), but if multiple kinds of specifications are present, they
serve as a logical AND (e.g., `-t thermal -d raa229618,tmp117` would yield
all thermal sensors from either device).

### `humility stackmargin`

`humility stackmargin` calculates and print stack margins by task. The
margin is determined by walking up each stack, looking for the first
word that does not contain the uninitialized pattern (`0xbaddcafe`),
from which it infers maximum depth, and therefore margin:

```console
% humility -d ./hubris.core.10 stackmargin
humility: attached to dump
ID TASK                STACKBASE  STACKSIZE   MAXDEPTH     MARGIN
 0 jefe               0x20001000       1024        768        256
 1 rcc_driver         0x20001400       1024        176        848
 2 usart_driver       0x20001800       1024        216        808
 3 user_leds          0x20001c00       1024        208        816
 4 ping               0x20002000        512        224        288
 5 pong               0x20002400       1024        208        816
 6 idle               0x20002800        256        104        152
```

Note that the margin is only valid for the task's lifetime -- and in
particular, will not be correct if the task has restarted due to a
stack overflow!



### `humility stmsecure`

Humility has support to manage the Root Security Services (RSS) and various
flash options bits

A typical sequence to set the secure region at 0x08000000

```rust
humility stmsecure set-secure-bit
humility stmsecure set-secure-region 0x08000000 0xa000
```

To undo the secure region:

```rust
humility stmsecure unset-secure-region
humility stmsecure unset-secure-bit
```

The STM32 has support for flash bank swapping as well

```rust
humility stmsecure bank-swap
```


### `humility tasks`

`humility tasks` offers a ps-like view of a system, e.g.:

```console
% humility tasks
humility: attached via ST-Link
system time = 1764993
ID TASK                 GEN PRI STATE
 0 jefe                   0   0 recv, notif: bit0 bit1(T+7)
 1 rcc_driver             0   1 recv
 2 gpio_driver            0   2 recv
 3 usart_driver           0   2 recv, notif: bit0(irq39)
 4 i2c_driver             0   2 recv
 5 spi_driver             0   2 recv
 6 user_leds              0   2 recv
 7 pong                   0   3 FAULT: killed by jefe/gen0 (was: recv, notif: bit0)
 8 ping               14190   4 wait: send to pong/gen0
 9 hiffy                  0   3 notif: bit0(T+7)
10 hf                     0   3 notif: bit0(T+18)
11 idle                   0   5 RUNNING
```

To see every field in each task, you can use the `-v` flag:

```console
% humility -d hubris.core.4 tasks -v
humility: attached to dump
system time = 1791860
ID TASK                 GEN PRI STATE
...
 7 pong                   0   3 FAULT: killed by jefe/gen0 (was: recv, notif: bit0)
   |
   +-----------> Task {
                    save: SavedState {
                        r4: 0x200063c4,
                        r5: 0x10,
                        r6: 0x1,
                        r7: 0x0,
                        r8: 0x60003,
                        r9: 0x4,
                        r10: 0x200063d4,
                        r11: 0x1,
                        psp: 0x20006330,
                        exc_return: 0xffffffed,
                        ...
                    },
                    priority: Priority(0x3),
                    state: Faulted {
                        fault: Injected(TaskId(0x0)),
                        original_state: InRecv(None)
                    },
                    ...
...
```

To see a task's registers, use the `-r` flag:

```console
% humility tasks -r user_leds
humility: attached via ST-Link
system time = 1990498
ID TASK                 GEN PRI STATE
 6 user_leds              0   2 recv
   |
   +--->   R0 = 0x20005fc8   R1 = 0x0000000c   R2 = 0x00000000   R3 = 0x20005fd8
           R4 = 0x20005fc8   R5 = 0x0000000c   R6 = 0x00000000   R7 = 0x00000000
           R8 = 0x08027154   R9 = 0x00000000  R10 = 0xfffffe00  R11 = 0x00000001
          R12 = 0x00000000   SP = 0x20005fa0   LR = 0x08026137   PC = 0x08026e42
```

To see a task's stack backtrace, use the `-s` flag:

```console
% humility tasks -s user_leds
humility: attached via ST-Link
system time = 2021382
ID TASK                 GEN PRI STATE
 6 user_leds              0   2 recv
   |
   +--->  0x20005fc0 0x08026e42 userlib::sys_recv_stub
          0x20006000 0x08026128 userlib::sys_recv
          0x20006000 0x08026128 idol_runtime::dispatch
          0x20006000 0x08026136 main
```

To additionally see line number information on a stack backtrace, also provide
`-l` flag:

```console
% humility tasks -sl user_leds
humility: attached via ST-Link
system time = 2049587
ID TASK                 GEN PRI STATE
 6 user_leds              0   2 recv
   |
   +--->  0x20005fc0 0x08026e42 userlib::sys_recv_stub
                     @ /home/bmc/hubris/sys/userlib/src/lib.rs:288
          0x20006000 0x08026128 userlib::sys_recv
                     @ /home/bmc/hubris/sys/userlib/src/lib.rs:236
          0x20006000 0x08026128 idol_runtime::dispatch
                     @ /home/bmc/.cargo/git/checkouts/idolatry-1ebf1c2fd2f30300/6d18e14/runtime/src/lib.rs:137
          0x20006000 0x08026136 main
                     @ /home/bmc/hubris/drv/user-leds/src/main.rs:110
```

These options can naturally be combined, e.g. `humility tasks -slvr`.



### `humility test`

When run against a test archive, `humility test` kicks off the test suite
and parses its results via ITM.

```console
humility: attached via ST-Link
humility: ITM synchronization packet found at offset 6
humility: expecting 22 cases
humility: running test_send ... ok
humility: running test_recv_reply ... ok
humility: running test_fault_badmem ... ok
humility: running test_fault_stackoverflow ... ok
humility: running test_fault_execdata ... ok
humility: running test_fault_illop ... ok
humility: running test_fault_nullexec ... ok
humility: running test_fault_textoob ... ok
humility: running test_fault_stackoob ... ok
humility: running test_fault_buserror ... ok
humility: running test_fault_illinst ... ok
humility: running test_fault_divzero ... ok
humility: running test_panic ... ok
humility: running test_restart ... ok
humility: running test_restart_taskgen ... ok
humility: running test_borrow_info ... ok
humility: running test_borrow_read ... ok
humility: running test_borrow_write ... ok
humility: running test_supervisor_fault_notification ... ok
humility: running test_timer_advance ... ok
humility: running test_timer_notify ... ok
humility: running test_timer_notify_past ... ok
humility: tests completed: pass
```

If a test fails, this will also create a complete report, e.g.:

```console
humility: attached via ST-Link
humility: ITM synchronization packet found at offset 6
humility: expecting 22 cases
humility: running test_send ... ok
humility: running test_recv_reply ... fail
humility: running test_fault_badmem ... ok
...
humility: running test_timer_notify_past ... ok
humility: tests completed: fail
humility: test output dumped to hubris.testout.15
```

This output file will have (among other things) a section that has
complete test run information.  For details on a failing test, look
for `result: Fail`:

```console
$ cat hubris.testout.15
...
==== Test results
[
    ...
    TestCompletion {
        case: "test_recv_reply",
        result: Fail,
        log: [
            (
                UserLog,
                "assistant starting",
            ),
            (
                KernelLog,
                "task @1 panicked: panicked at \'assertion failed: false\', test/test-suite/src/main.rs:124:5",
            ),
            (
                UserLog,
                "Task #1 Panic!",
            ),
            (
                UserLog,
                "assistant starting",
            ),
        ],
    },
    ...
```

This shows the sequential ordering of all log messages while running the
test.  The test report can also be useful even when tests pass; to always
dump a test report, use the `-d` option to `humility test`.

Note that `humility test` relies on the ability to keep up with ITM data,
which can be lossy.  In the event ITM data is lost, the failure mode is
unlikely to be a failing test, but rather a fatal error due to a misframed
packet:

```console
humility: running test_fault_nullexec ... ok
humility: running test_fault_textoob ... ok
humility: running test_fault_stackoob ... humility: test output dumped to hubris.testout.21
humility: test failed: malformed datum: 0x74
Error: test failed
```

All received packet data will be dumped to the resulting output file,
allowing these transient failures to be differentiated from deeper issues.
