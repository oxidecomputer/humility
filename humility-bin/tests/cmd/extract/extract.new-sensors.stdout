# For the kernel (and for any task that logs), we are required to enable
# either "itm" (denoting logging/panicking via ARM's Instrumentation Trace
# Macrocell) or "semihosting" (denoting logging/panicking via ARM
# semihosting).  We are biased to ITM because semihosting is excruciatingly
# slow (it is breakpoint based) and has an undesirable failure mode if logging
# output is generated and debugger is not attached (namely, the target stops).
# If one does choose to change this to semihosting for purposes of
# development, be sure to also change it in every task of interest.
