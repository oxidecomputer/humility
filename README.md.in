# Humility

Humility is the debugger for
<a href="https://github.com/oxidecomputer/hubris">Hubris</a>.

## Guiding principles

### Production disposition

Hubris is the artifact that actually runs, and it must be allowed to be
optimized in terms of size, space, and run-time; in as much as contortions are
required for debuggability, they should be borne by Humility, not Hubris.  As a
concrete example of this, Humility operates exclusively on `release` builds of
Hubris, relying on (unloaded) DWARF information in the binaries to make sense of
the system.

### Hubris-specific

Humility is Hubris-specific:  it is not trying to be a generic *in situ*
debugger, but rather specifically focused on debugging Hubris-based systems.
Humility is therefore willing to encode Hubris-specific concepts like
archives and tasks.

### Microcontroller-specific

Debuggers must cut through abstractions, which
often requires knowledge of underlying
implementation detail.  For Humility, this means being willing to take
advantage of microcontroller-specific debug facilities where applicable.
While Hubris may make decisions in the name of greater portability,
Humility will generally make decisions to maximize debuggability, even
where these facilities are highly specific to a particular MCU.

### Device-specific

Humility is unafraid to offer device-specific functionality where that
functionality is useful for system debuggability.  (For example,
`humility i2c` functions as an I<sup>2</sup>C analyzer.)  That said, all device
interaction uses Hubris as a proxy to actually communicate with the devices
themselves (e.g., via [HIF](https://github.com/oxidecomputer/hif));
Humility does not seek to create second I/O path.

### Pragmatic

Humility seeks to be *useful*, and therefore seeks to offer all manners of
debugging: in situ, postmortem, dynamic instrumentation, static
instrumentation, etc.

## Operation

Humility operates by specifying a subcommand.  There are options that
are Humility-wide (that is, applying to every subcommand), as well as
options that are specific to particular subcommands.

### Probe

Humility needs to have some way of extracting information and/or controlling
the microcontroller running Hubris.  This is done through some variant of a
debug *probe*, a separate microcontroller that speaks to debug-specific
functionality on the target microcontroller.  (For details of the mechanics
of these probes on ARM parts, see <a
href="https://65.rfd.oxide.computer">RFD 65</a>.)

For most evaluation boards, this debug probe is available on the board, and
is connected to a host via USB, e.g. ST's STLink/V2 on the STM32F407
Discovery or the LPC-Link2 present on the LPCXpresso55S69.
(On the Gemini board, there are two SWD headers, one for the LPC55S28
and the other for the STM32H753.)
While Humility allows for direct attachment to an on-chip debugger, doing so
precludes other connections (from, for example, OpenOCD), making it too
disruptive to development workflows. To allow for easier development
workflows, Humility also has the option to attach via OpenOCD.

The debug probe to use is specified to Humility via the `-p` option
(long form `--probe`) or the `HUMILITY_PROBE` environment variable,
which can have the following values:

- `auto` (default): Automatically determine how to attach to the
  microcontroller.

- `ocd`: Attach via OpenOCD, which is presumed to have the TCL interface
  available on localhost on port 6666 (its default).

- `jlink`: Attach via Segger JLink, which is presumed to have the GDB
  interface available on localhost on port 2331 (its default).  Note that
  when semihosting is being used by Hubris, the Segger JLink GDB server
  will become confused when Humility attaches to it -- and subsequent
  calls to semihosting will cause a halt.  A subsequent Humility invocation
  will resume the target (directing semihosting output correctly to the
  running GDB instance), but subsequent semihosting output will again cause
  a halt. To recover from this condition, send an explicit ^C to the
  running GDB and continue from the resulting stop.

- `usb`: Attach directly via USB to a debug probe.  When multiple probes
  are plugged in via USB, a probe index must be specified as a suffix
  (e.g., `usb-0`, `usb-1`, etc.)  To determine which probe is which,
  examine the serial number in the output of `humility probe`.

- `vid:pid[:serial]`: In some cases, the automatic algorithm may either find
  the wrong thing, or timeout attempting to search for non-existent probes.
  In these cases, it can help to explicitly set the vendor ID (VID) and
  product ID (PID) of the debug probe, which should be colon-delimited, e.g.,
  `0483:374e`.  (Determining the VID and PID of an attached probe is
  platform-specific; on Linux one can use the `lsusb` command.)  In cases
  where there are multiple probes with the same VID and PID, the serial number
  of the probe (as reported via `humility probe` or found in the 
  `iSerialNumber` field of the USB device descriptor) can be postpended,
  also delimited by a colon, e.g. `0483:374e:004000343137510939383538`.

### Archive

Many Humility commands require the complete Hubris archive.  This is a ZIP
archive created by the build process, and includes all binaries as well as the
`app.toml` file used to configure the Hubris archive.  The archive can be
found in the `target` for Hubris, and will end with (`.zip`), e.g.:
`/path/to/hubris/target/demo-stm32h743-nucleo/dist/build-demo-stm32h743-nucleo.zip`.
The Hubris archive is specified via the `-a` option or the `HUMILITY_ARCHIVE`
environment variable.

**In the Humility examples in this documentation, unless otherwise specified,
the archive will be assumed to be set via `-a` or `HUMILITY_ARCHIVE`.**

### Dump

Many Humility commands are able to operate *postmortem* on a Hubris dump,
an ELF core file generated by the `humility dump` command.
Dumps are offered in lieu of a probe and an archive and specified via
the `-d` option (long form `--dump`) or the `HUMILITY_DUMP` environment
variable.

### Chip

While some autodetection is possible, Humility regrettably may need to be made
aware of the specifics of the target chip.  Supported chips include:

- `STM32F407VGTx` (default): STM32F407 as found on the reference Discovery board
- `LPC55S69JBD100`: LPC55S69 as found on the LPCXpresso55S69
- `STM32H7B3LIHxQ`: STM32H7B3 as found on the STM32H7B3I-DK

The target chip can be specified via the `-c` option or the `HUMILITY_CHIP`
environment variable.
